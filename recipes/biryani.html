    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Biryani is a fragrant, 
        one-pot rice dish made by layering marinated meat (or vegetables) 
        with parboiled basmati rice, spices, herbs, and caramelized onions.
        The pot is sealed and slow-cooked using the "dum" method, allowing 
        the meat to tenderize and the rice to absorb the rich aromatic flavors.

    <h4>Steps to Cook</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate Chicken: </strong>
            Mix chicken with yogurt, spices, 
            lemon juice, half of the fried onions, 
            mint, coriander, and ginger-garlic paste. 
            Marinate for at least 30 minutes to overnight.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fry Onions: </strong>
            Thinly slice onions and fry them in ghee until golden brown and crispy.
            Set aside
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Rice: </strong>
            Bring water to a boil with whole spices (bay leaf, cardamom, etc.) 
            and salt. Add soaked rice and cook until 70-80% done (firm but cooked). 
            Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook Chicken: </strong>
             In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat ghee, add remaining aromatics, 
             then add the marinated chicken. 
             Cook for 10-15 minutes until the oil separates and 
             chicken is nearly done.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Layering: </strong>
            Reduce heat. Top the chicken with a layer of fried onions, 
            mint, and coriander. Add the cooked rice, 
            then top with saffron milk, remaining fried onions, 
            and a drizzle of ghee.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Dum Cooking: </strong>
            Seal the pot with a tight lid (or aluminum foil/dough). 
            Cook on low heat for 15-20 minutes, or 
            place the pot on a hot tawa (griddle) to prevent burning.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Serve: </strong>
            Turn off the heat and let it rest for 10 minutes before serving. 
            Gently mix from the bottom when serving.
