            490 ml <em>full fat coconut milk</em>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps to Cook</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sear the Chicken: </strong>
            Heat the oil in a large skillet or 
            pan over medium-high heat. 
            Add the chicken pieces and cook for 5 minutes until sealed 
            and lightly browned on all sides. 
            Remove and set aside (optional, but helps keep chicken tender).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Saute Aromatics :</strong>
            Reduce heat to medium. 
            Add the chopped onions to the same pan and cook for 5-7 minutes 
            until softened and golden. Add the garlic, ginger, curry powder, 
            coriander, cumin, paprika, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. 
            Cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly to toast the spices.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Build the Sauce: </strong>
            Add the tomato puree, canned tomatoes, chicken stock, 
            and coconut milk. Stir well to combine, 
            scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Simmer: </strong>
            Return the chicken (and any juices) to the pan. 
            Bring to a gentle boil, then turn down the heat and 
            simmer for 10-15 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked and
            the sauce has thickened.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Finish and Serve: </strong>
             If you prefer a thicker sauce, 
             stir in the cornflour slurry (optional). 
             Stir in the baby spinach (if using) until wilted. 
             Garnish with fresh coriander.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve: </strong>
            Serve hot over steamed basmati rice or with naan bread.
